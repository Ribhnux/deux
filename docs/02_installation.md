> Install Deux-CLI on your computer with easy step.

Basically you don't need to install `yarn`, since NodeJS already have a package manager called `npm`, but some people likes `yarn` rather than `npm`.

To install `Deux-CLI`, choose these commands you prefer:

```bash
# Install with `yarn`
yarn global install deux-cli
```

```bash
# Install with `npm`
npm install deux-cli -g
```

After installation was completed, you're now ready to using `Deux-CLI`. If you've got errors when installing `Deux-CLI`, please visit our repo and submit an issue.
