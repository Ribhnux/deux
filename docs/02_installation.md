> Install Deux-CLI on your computer with easy steps.

Since NodeJS already have a package manager called `npm`, basically you don't need to install `yarn`, but some people prefer using yarn rather than `npm` because it's speed.

To install `deux-cli`, type these commands you prefer:

```bash
# Install with `yarn`
yarn global install deux-cli
```

```bash
# Install with `npm`
npm install deux-cli -g
```

After installation complete, now you're using basic `deux-cli` command. If you've got errors when installing `deux-cli`, please submit issue in our repo.
